# dyadRobust

This package estimates cluster-robust standard errors for dyadic data using multiway decomposition as decsribed in Aronow, Peter M., Cyrus Samii, and Valentina A. Assenova. "Cluster-robust variance estimation for dyadic data." Political Analysis 23.4 (2015): 564-577. It was developed by [James Bisbee](http://www.jamesbisbee.com/) and [Pedro Rodriguez](http://prodriguezsosa.com/)

It is built on the replication materials for the same, available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OMJYE5. The value-add of this package is to dramatically reduce the computation time required to calculate these standard errors, as illustrated in the figure below.
